## Description

Introducing a widget that lets you easily create annotation text using an L-shaped path. You can freely input text and use it for notes, documents, or discussions. The creator's icon, name, and date/time are also displayed. Optionally, these can be hidden. The direction of the path can be specified to the left, right, up, or down, and a path is automatically generated towards the target. Four color options are available: red, orange, green, and blue.

How to use:

1. Add the widget.
2. Enter your desired text.
3. Select the node you want to annotate.
4. Press the focus button on the top right of the widget.

Options will be displayed by selecting the widget, and a menu will appear.
